slack and QA

Recorded sessions - Asynchronous
--------------------------
no interactive
no immidiate feedback
get some doubt, you will post and you get response after sometime.

http://34.230.44.179/api/catalogue/categories --> we are sending a message to our web component about the categories, it is immidiately sending the response

Synchronous HTTP --> you will query, you will get response
but what if catalogue server down, we will not get response

sivakumar --> http --> if ramesh offline
---------------------------------------
your message is lost, because ramesh is offline


1. Queue

MQ(Messaging Queue) Server
--------------
Ramesh Queue
Sivakumar Queue

youtube --> when you subscribe to channel, you will get notification
one to many

when video is published to the channel, youtube will send a message to channel topic. all users whoever subscribed will be listening to the channel, they will get immidiate notification.


House

labours, engineers are working together --> we are expecting a well built home without any issues. single home

Project
-------------
lot of developers, testers, architects --> for a application i.e artifact(single file)
compiling and creating a package.

we don't do everything on our own, we will refer libraries already developed code, you can use them as libraries.

Automation
------------------
1. Everytime you need to configure same steps for the server(Ansible)
2. here we are using IP address, when you stop/start the server always IP address is chaning. we need domains. roboshop.com
3. What if traffic is more, we need to scale the servers --> Autoscaling
4. We need to monitor for the errors. System resources should be monitored always. --> monitoring
5. Resource utilisation(Containerisation) --> min servers but more perfomance.
6. Automatic deployments(CICD) --> when ever developer released a new feature
	compile
	package
	scan
	remove old version
	release new version
7. we are creating servers manually, we need to automated infrastrcuture --> terraform
8. https

DNS(Domain name system)
-----------------------
buy cheapest domain for training --> Hostinger
domain provider...

DNS works?
------------------
Browser --> cache
OS --> OS cache
OS --> ISP
OS --> DNS Server --> DNS cache

Root servers
-------------
ISP knows root servers.

root servers are managed by independent organisations called as ICANN as non profit

Internet corporation for assgined names and numbers

they have 13 root servers across the world for high available purpose.

Domain provider --> Hostinger --> to update root servers about the domain

a user sivakumar bought a domain, and nameservers

joindevops.online --> sivakumar
ns1.dns-parking.com
ns2.dns-parking.com


ISP --> root server

root server --> domain nameservers

ISP --> nameservers(who is managing your domain) --> hostinger

A --> your website point to which IP

max 24hrs to reflect the domain

we need to change the ownership of domain for automation
--------------------------------------------
hostiger will connect root servers and update change in nameservers
