jenkins shared library
--------------------
DRY
you can implement all best standards in single place and force everyone to follow.
if a change needs to be done, you can do single place
we no need to pollute developer code with devops script

groovy+jenkins pipeline syntax

steps:
---------
1. write shared library
2. configure in jenkins system
3. refer in Jenkinsfile

everything in shared library is a function,

string
list
map
boolean
number

map --> key/value pair
list --> list of values

I need to tell library, about language and deployment so that it can decide which pipeline to call...
I need to tell the component like cart, catalogue, payment, etc.

everything in a library is function, you can call a function particularly like <file-name>.<function-name>

if you have a function with name call(). then no need to specially mention function-name.

New Project
------------------
As a DevOps and Infra engineer we created

DEV Infra --> here create a role for EC2
CI --> shared library
CD pipeline

Developer wants to go for PROD

As a DevOps and Infra engineer we need to create PROD infra


1. maintain seperate repo
2. control through tfvars and backend config

/roboshop/dev/mongodb_url

/roboshop/prod/mongodb_url

ansible templates
-----------------------


IAM
----------
identity access management

authentication --> prove you are company employee
authorization --> prove you have access to particular project in a company

User --> username/password or username/token or username/accesscard

Role --> what is your role, employee or lead or manager or MD or CTO or CEO
Permission -->
	employee --> what are the permissions
	lead --> what are the permissions
	CEO --> what are the permissions
	
sivakumar joined a company
-----------------------
they will create user sivakumar in the system and assign a employee role

sivakumar --> employee

remove employee role and add lead role

AWS
---------------
everything here is resource

EC2
	resource/noun: can he access all resources or particular resources
	actions/verbs: create/update/read/delete
VPC
Route53
SSM parameter store

Role is not only for humans it is for resources also, so that you can control the access to your resources...

ansible is running in EC2, now this ansible wants to have access to SSM parameter store

so we have to attach role to EC2.
