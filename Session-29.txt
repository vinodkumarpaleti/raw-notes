VPC

we are going to develop VPC module, so that anyone in our organisation can use this.

High Availability --> create resources in 2 AZ

VPC
IGW
2 public subnets --> 1 1a, 2 1b
2 private subnets --> 1 1a, 2 1b
2 database subnets --> 1 1a, 2 1b
group our database subnets
seperate route table for public
seperate route table for private
seperate route table for database
route table and subnet associations
NAT gateway

module --> terraform-aws-vpc

roboshop-infra --> we will refer the terraform-aws-vpc


ec2 instance

resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance"

every resource have common tags
	project roboshop
	environment 
	terraform
	
individual tags --> route table
Name --> roboshop-public

2 private subnets
----------------------
module developer, you need to create resource definition

count = 2, you need 2 cidr that should come from user, 2 az that should again come from, merge common tags with private subnet names

2 subnets
aws_subnet.public[0]
aws_subnet.public[1]

aws_subnet.public[*] --> list of subnets created

aws_subnet.public[*].id = ["subnet-01267e3f0a096eb72","subnet-02b6d0911a7eafa35"]

100 teams in a amazon
1 single team can develop modules

100 teams can use it, less efforts

central team can make some best practices and some security.

to reduce the cost central team decided only 2 az...

modules
	1. code reuse
	2. force some best practices and standars according to company
	
1. create your modules

2. use open source modules
