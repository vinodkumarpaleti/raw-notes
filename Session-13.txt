condition in shell script
------------------------

7 days
MON-SAT have school
SUN is holday

today

if(today=="sunday"){
	print holiday, enjoy
}
else{
	print go to school, happy larning
}


if(expression){
	expression=true, then statements here will run
}
else{
	if above is expression is false, then this will run
}

algorithm
----------------
install git

1. you should be root user, otherwise it will fail


if [ expression ]
then
	these commands will run if expression is true
else
	these commands will run if expression is false
fi

1. check root user or not
2. if not root user, exit the program and inform user to run with sudo access
3. if root user install mysql


root user id -u --> 0
normal user id -u --> not 0

100 statements

you got error at statement 10,

shell script by default it will not stop if it faces error, it is our responsibility to check for the errors

exit status
---------------
$? --> it will store the previous command status

$? --> 0 then previous command is success
$? --> 1-127 previous command is failure

less lines of code, more work

functions
---------------
you will keep some code inside functions which is more often repeated, and call whenever you erquire

functions will do some work on behalf of us and it will update what happend

FUNCTION_NAME(){
	here you write your statements, and call this function wherever required.
}

you need to give inputs, then functions will give output


FUNCTION_NAME

log files are important to know what happend

redirections
----------------
> --> it will only redirect success output

1 --> success
2 --> failure
& --> both success and failure

ls -l > ls.log

ls -l 1> ls.log

ls -l &>ls.log

> --> it will remove previous content, and adds new content
>> --> it will not remove, it will append

$1--> first argument
$2--> second argument

colors in shell scripting
-----------------------

\e[31m --> red
\e[32m --> green


loops
---------------
if you ask 10 packages to install
I want to loop it, then install one by one...

for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
	print i
}

0
0<100 - true --> then it will enter
print 0
1
1<100 --> then it will enter 
print 1
2
.
...

...
99
99<100
print 99
100

for variable in list
do
	write your statement
done

sudo sh 12-loops.sh git mysql postfix 

you run a command multiple times --> duplicates may create
you run a command multiple times --> nothing will happen
