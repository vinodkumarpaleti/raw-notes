Whatsapp --> point to point, queue based
Youtube --> publish and subscribe, topic

DNS
-----------
joindevops.com --> .com TLD

Records
-----------
A --> ipv4 address

installation
configurations
deployments

without Shell Scripting
------------------
1. manual installations
2. time taking
3. easy to do mistakes
4. more time if you have to do multiple times

20 commands to deploy user component
-------------------------

keep 20 commands in a file and run at a time --> shell script

shell script is native scripting of Linux servers

if you want to do anything in linux that should go through shell..

python is application inside linux server.

python --> shell 

10 hindi persons --> Hindi
5 hindi 5 english --> English

something out of linux go for python

9AM --> 9PM

I need to stop DEV EC2, RDS instances outof office hours

script --> AWS Cloud
stop at 9PM
start at 9AM 

Automations inside Linux, that is internal...go for shell script
Automations outsid Linux, that is external .. go for python script

Coding
1. Programming --> Java, Python(programming), Go, NodeJS --> less time, more perfomance, less resources --> Data structures, algorithms, design patterns

2. Scripting --> automation --> instead of manual tasks

variables
data types
conditions
loops
functions

in a genereal way what should be done
-------------------------------------

Source code management/ version control system
------------------------------------------------

1. you should not store coding in laptops/desktop
2. you should store in repos for safety/security
3. version control, you can go back to previous versions
4. branches --> master --> PROD
	create a branch from master --> edit the changes --> raise a PR --> every team member can review the changes --> if good then approve and merge
5. you can track who is doing what
	

	do one more copy of important file
	edit the copied file
	check for syntax/error
	if everything is file, then you replace original file

IDE --> Integrated development enviroment --> VS Code

Git --> concept of vcs

GitHub --> public/ private installation --> they will give their package --> we need to install in our own servers
GitLab
BitBucket

https://github.com/ --> you are storing code in github servers

ec2 --> github.joindevops.online --> install GitHub

repository --> stores something --> storing the code

GitHub
----------------
1. create repo
2. clone into your laptop
3. select the main branch. usually we keep master as main branch
	git branch -M master
4. do some coding

GitBash
1. SSH client
2. Git client --> Git Servers

GitHub is de centralised distribution system
------------------------------------------
centralised capital --> everything in a sinle place

de centralised capital
	delhi --> all the gov building
	bang, hyd, chennai --> software
	kolkata, mubai --> industrial
	
as a de centralised system --> you need to preserve the history

git add README.MD --> saving the changes into temp/stagig area
git commit -m "First time commit" --> commiting the changes into local repo

git config --global user.email "info@joindevops.com"     --> we need a user email to understand who did this change
git config --global user.name "sivakumarreddy"

git push origin master --> pushing the changes to central repo
1. token based
2. SSH based

1. create repo in central, and work with it
2. you have existing folder, how can you push
