Dockerfile
Building image
running docker-compose

Ansible
------------
AMI - centos8
configured server
	installed nodejs
	cart
	created user
	copied application 
	run application
AMI --> heavy size and occupies more space compared to docker image

Volumes
-------------
image/container in docker is ephemeral, data will be delete once you remove container

if we run DB(RDMS/NoSQL/Redis/MQ) as container, by default data will be remove once container is deleted.

1. un named volumes
2. named volumes

-p <host-port>:<container-port>

-v <host-path>:<container-path>

/usr/share/nginx/html

-v /nginx-data:/usr/share/nginx/html

/var/lib/docker/overlay2 --> temp volumes
/var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx/_data --> named volumes

1. you create directory
2. we have to manage the directory

named volumes
----------------
volume will have name,
everything can be managed docker commands

mongodb
mysql
redis
rabbitmq

best practices
------------------------
alpine the very less in size image..
