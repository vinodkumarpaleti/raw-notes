Ansible is push, but ansible recently added pull also for some advantages

we were loading catalogue categories through catalogue app...
it is DB team responsibility to load the data...

install ansible

ansible is developed using python, we need python evnironment to run ansible
ansible to integrate with AWS, we need boto3 and botocore

boto3 and botocore --> AWS python libraries

ansible-pull -U <git-repo> -e variable playbook.yaml

mongodb --> terraform --> creating ec2 --> user_data --> downloading ansible playbooks through pull --> running locally

*.app.joindevops.online --> private ALB
1 private ALB --> DEV
1 private ALB --> PROD

catalogue-dev.app-dev.joindevops.online --> DEV ALB
catalogue-prod.app-prod.joindevops.online

Infra
	Project Infra --> VPC, VPN, LB, DB, Route53 --> eternal
	Application Infra --> ephemeral
	
Application Infra --> DevOps Engineer or Developer responsibility


Developer
------------
create feature branch
change version

every commit developer is doing to remote repo, we need to trigger pipeline that checks everything

ansible --> catalogue --> parameters from SSM

VM deployments
----------------
immutable --> cant change --> servers are fixed
1 DEV --> IP always same

ansible-playbook push can work


mutable --> can change
ansible-pull --> configure --> AMI
input to ASG
