tfvars
------------
Ansible --> config code is same, but how can we use same code to configure multi ENV
hosts and different variables

IaaC
-------------
consistency across multi ENV, we can use same code but different variables

we need 10 instances in DEV and 10 instances in PROD

r53 records
--------
mongodb-dev, mongodb-prod

1. variables.tf --> you can keep default values here, it is not mandatory to keep default values. but you should declare variable.
2. terraform.tfvars --> to override default values inside variables or else no need to keep default values inside, we can directly provide from tfvars file


1. different variable values
2. different state, you need to give different location to store PROD state

multi ENV
----------------
1. maintain different repos
	roboshop-DEV
	roboshop-PROD
	
pros: code is completly different, so that we dotn mess with DEV and PROD
cons: you need to work on multiple repos, code is duplicated in 2 repos

2. same code but different variable and config

pros: code is reused
cons: you should be very careful while chaging, same code is reflecting to PROD also

3. terraform workspaces


Jenkins CICD or manual
-------------------------------

DEV
terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=DEV/backend.tf

PROD
terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=PROD/backend.tf


Modules
-----------------------------
DRY --> dont repeat yourself

you create code, reuse it instead of writing same again and again

we will create code --> modules

whenever you need you can always call modules

keep code in one folder, call it from any no of repos
