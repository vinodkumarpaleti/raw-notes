Universal concepts
----------------------
variables --> inputs
data types
conditions
loops
functions

additional concepts
----------------------
outputs
locals
data sources


output "output-variable-name" {
	value = "value"
}

map

tags --> simple but powerful

key=value

Name=some-name
Environment=DEV/QA/PROD
Terraform=true
Component=MongoDB
Project=Roboshop

conditions
----------
if(expression){
	if true these statements run
}
else{
	if false these statements run
}

expression ? "this will run if true" : "this will run if false"

if MongoDB we are creating t3.medium otherwise t2.micro


loops
-----------
1. count and count index


functions
-----------
I want to crete ec2 instance with key
aws-linux-2
with key
provide public key to the instance

1. create public key
2. create ec2 instance


locals
------------
locals is also a type of variables, but it can have expressions and functions


AMI ID are frequently chaning
AMI ID is different for different environment

data sources --> you can query the data dynamically from source i.e AWS

I want to create security group in default VPC,

you have old resources created manullay, now you are using terraform to create resources and you have dependency on old resources, so you use data source to fetch info dynamically



t2.micro --> t3.medium

t2.micro --> m4.xlarge

1. change the existing resource --> update resource
2. terminate the resource --> create new resource [you lose the data]

if web you need to have public ip
otherwise private ip

for loop
dynamic blocks
terraform state and remote state
terraform.tfvars
