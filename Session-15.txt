disk usage
------------------
we need to continously check disk memory and send alert emails if it is more thn threshold

assignment
---------------
install gmail in linux server through shell script
prompt user for gmail username, password and complete installation



algorithm
-----------
1. check disk memory
2. compare with threshold(10)
3. if more than threshold trigger alert email

command to check memory

df -hT --> to check disk memory
ccozeaekfdtgqchg

us-east-1c --> EBS also should be in the same AZ

F
G

usually you have lot of alerts, you need to prepare template email and trigger this with respective alerts and email messages.

sed editor
--------------
streamline editor --> temp editor --> it will do changes temp not perm

CRUD
---------
creation of line
update the lines
delete the lines

sed -e '1 a Good morning' passwd
adding good morning after line to file passwd

I want before line 1
sed -e '1 i Good morning' passwd

if you want perm use -i option instead of -e

sed -e 's/<word-to-find>/<word-to-replace>/' <file-name>
this one will replace the first occurence in every line

if you want all occurences you need to use g, g for global

sed -e '/word-to-delete/ d' passwd
