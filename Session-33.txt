vpc-1
vpc-2
public subnet vpc-1
public subnet vpc-2
internet gateways
add the route of internet gateway to the route tables
add the route of vpc peering to the route tables

--------------------
modem --> AWS data center

VPC should have inernet gateway
subnet
route should be there from internet gateway

vpc-1 is requesting
vpc-2 should accept



vpc-1 should add the road to the vpc-2 through peering connection

10.1.0.0/16

vpc-2 should add the road to the vpc-1 through peering connection
10.0.0.0/16

vpc cidr should not overlap
