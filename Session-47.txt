Project Infra --> mostly one time, rare changes

CI Process --> clone, build, unit test, scans, artifact upload

application deployment
----------------------
Application infra --> ephemeral, changes every release
we need to pass app_version so that ansible can download from nexus at runtime

target group
launch template
auto scaling
policy
rule

de-registration delay
---------------------
register --> register instance to target group
de-register --> when traffic is decreased, we need to remove the instance...

if a instnace is already serving few requests, may be 20 requests....

clients will get some error....
de-registration-delay --> 300 sec, it means instance is marked for de-register

but it will not immidiately happen, it will wait for 5min to complete the exisiting requests

at the same time it will not accept new requests

destroy the current instance, and create new ASG...
if destroy --> APP will be down
you need to wait until it create again --> 5min

create before destroy
----------------
create new autoscaling group and destroy the previous one

CICD
---------------

change management process team --> business analyst
------------------------
CR request --> they will write what has to be changed, by which date
client will decide version --> 1.4.0



Shared libraries
------------------
DRY --> dont repeat yourself
dont pollute developers code with devops code
keep code in shared libraries,

keep your CI code in shared library, parameterize it

individual componets call those libraries by passing values to parameters

catalogue
--------
nodejs
vm deployment

cart
--------
nodejs
vm deployment

user
--------
nodejs
vm deployment

I want to implement best standards of CI process in roboshop project
