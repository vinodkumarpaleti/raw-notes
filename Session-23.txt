Multiple environments
---------------------
we will have DEV and PROD
how can ansible configure multiple environments with single playbook

working in DEV, not working in PROD

Ansible playbook --> you have to use for both DEV and PROD

OS, OS version, Packages and their versions, services and their status, directory, permissions, etc...

IP address --> DEV and PROD have different IP
password --> in DEV DB password is different, PROD DB password is different

by having diff inventory
not recommended to keep in github or any where users can read, 
secrets manager --> store passwords here, retreive at run time
pass from command line or prompt

parellelism
----------------
ansible can connect to all servers at a time

1000 catalogue
to connect 1000 servers, ansible servers should have more RAM, CPU, etc.

6 servers, nginx install

heterogenous
------------
multiple linux distributions

Ubuntu --> adduser
Centos --> useradd

- name: Add the user 'johnd' with a specific uid and a primary group of 'admin'
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: johnd
    comment: John Doe
    uid: 1040
    group: admin
	
gather_facts: 

it will check dynamically what is distribution
