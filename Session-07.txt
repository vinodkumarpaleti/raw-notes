AWS Regions, AZ
AMI --> Amazon machine image

AWS resources are mostly region based, few services are global

AZ is for disaster recovery purpose.

HA --> we can create resources atleast in 2AZ.
DR --> move resources immidiately to another AZ. move resources to another region, but it takes few hours

AMI --> Amazon Machine image

We frequently need nginx servers to install applications.

OS + Install package + configure service/package

We can create image out of server.

stable vs moving

when server is running, by the time you take photo of server, many things may happen. it leads to errors.

Windows OS + install MS office + Anti virus = Windows-10.iso

devops-practice --> AMI for entire course
-------------------
It is username and password --> centos DevOps321
centos8 = AWS Linux 2 = RHEL8 = Fedora

Developers, architects
-----------------------
What programming languages
What are the tools and versions of programming

DevOps architects
-----------------
DevOps tools and versions

google.com --> allow
facebook.com --> don't allow
youtube.com

a show is only visible in US region.

your phone is a server which has some files

your client is laptop which is requesting to view files

developer write the code --> compile --> build/package

java -> .jar
all languages --> .zip

RDBMS --> SQL --> Relation Database management system --> Rows and Columns
NoSQL --> No SQL -> no tables no rows and columns --> data is based on documents and collections --> js files

RDBMS vs NoSQL

MongoDB --> NoSQL

netstat -lntp

27017 --> mongodb

127.0.0.1 --> localhost

By default some servers mostly DB servers, you can't open them apart from local server. this is for security

catalogue
------------------
this is microservice developed in nodejs

write the code --> compile --> packaged --> .zip file

we need to install node environment

system/service user
-------------------
user --> human
system(non-human) --> on behalf of users, applications have dedicated users for security

install dependencies/libraries --> 
maven --> pom.xml
nodejs/js --> package.json
requirements.txt --> python

Tasks
----------
Forward vs Reverse proxy
MySQL and NoSQL
what is system user in linux
