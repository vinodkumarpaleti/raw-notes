persist the logfiles --> output redirection
color --> user experience
validations --> exit status, we need to take decission

algorithm
----------------
task: install multiple package with single script

user will pass the packages through command line

user should have root access
while installing store the logs
implement colors for user experience
before installing it is always good to check whether package is already installed or not
if installed skip, otherwise proceed for installation
check successfully installed or not


we need to delete log files more than 2 weeks

/home/centos/app-logs

only .log files should be deleted, dont delete any other files
go to the folder
get all the log files with extension of .log
check the date
if date is more than 2 weeks old delete

find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +14 

sh <script-name> --> for this no need of execute permission
./<script-name> --> it should have execute permission


disk usage
------------------------------
write a shell script that should check disk usage every one hour, and send alert email if it is consuming more than 80%

you need to have gmail installed in linux


we dont have browser
everything is command

tcs --> @tcs.com @cts.com
