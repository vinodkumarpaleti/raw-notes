variables and data types
conditions
expression ? "true statements" : "false statements"
count and count index
data sources
locals --> you can run expressions and functions in local
outputs --> to print the output on to terminal

loops
---------------
count and count index --> iterate on list

for each --> map/list

let's create 10 instances using for loop

mongodb and mysql t3.medium
for others t2.micro

for_each when you iterate over a map, it will give us one special variable i.e each

each.key and each.value

dynamic block

count or for each is to create more resources with single syntax

state and remote state
-------------------------
declarative scripting that can create resources based on tf files

declarative = terraform responsibility to create resources whatever you write in tf files

tf files = declaration = ordering terraform

state = terraform has to know what resources it is created

terraform.tfstate = terraform will see this file to understand the resources it created already

tf files = terraform.tfstate

now tf files dont have egress but terraform.tfstate has egress

to delete egress and update terraform.tfstate

terraform is a declarative scripting, terraform responsibility is to create resources declared in tf files, terraform will create terraform.tfstate to understand the resources it created
all the time terraform tries to match tf files with state file


remote state
------------
we have few serious problems if you keep state file in the repo or local folder

devops engineer 1 and devops engineer 2 joined the project

engineer1 --> he will clone
engineer2 --> he will clone

1. duplicate resources
2. error while creating resources saying already exist
3. accidental changes


s3 bucket, you keep your state file and lock with dynamo DB
