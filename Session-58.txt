----------------
1. Replica set
2. Deployment set
3. daemon set
4. statefulset

when you provision user, you change nginx conf and include user reverse proxy
push changes to git
do docker build --> build and push again to docker hub
restart the container

when the code is changed then only go for build,
if config changed, you should not go for image build, you should restart

we can keep config files also in config map...
